# ESP3oat

Hi everybody ! Welcome to the ESP3oat project !

Our objective is too create an autonomous Boat with GPS correction (PID and ultrasound detection) with the aim of being eco-friendly and eco-usefull by adding options : 
  - pH, temperature (sub and on board), salinity ; 
  - water sampling ; 
  - sonar function ; 
  - waste collection. 
Moreover, we want our boat to be wifi controllable. For this, we using an ESP32 in a role of station (ESPStation) with Wifi, Joystick, communication module nRF24l01. The boat (ArduiBoat) embedded an Arduino Mega with an other communication module nRF24l01 and all the sensors we need. We really wanted a station cause we want to able to command our boat without web connection for GPS test (if the path is already set and load in the ESP32) and fun driving...

We want to thank you all for your support, especially our teachers followig us on this project : M. LAUFFENBURGER and M. RODOLFO.
